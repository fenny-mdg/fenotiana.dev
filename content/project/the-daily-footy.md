- Overview: The Daily Footy is a platform that provides news, rumors, match
  results, and upcoming match schedules for various football leagues, including
  La Liga, Premier League, MLS, and the Saudi league.
- Technologies Used: Built with Remix, styled using Tailwind CSS and Shadcn, and
  uses MongoDB as the database. Deployed on my personal VPS with continuous
  deployment handled via GitHub Actions.
- Challenges and Solutions: The major challenge was handling large amounts of
  data while ensuring performance remained optimal. By optimizing query handling
  and database indexing, I managed to provide quick access to football data.
