- Overview: A simple educational site that allows users to download YouTube
  videos or audio files. It serves as a learning tool, and I do not take
  responsibility for any misuse.
- Technologies Used: Built with Remix and Tailwind CSS, similar to The Daily
  Footy. Deployed on my personal VPS with continuous deployment using GitHub
  Actions.
- Challenges and Solutions: Ensuring that the download process was smooth
  without violating usage policies was key. I ensured compliance by providing
  clear disclaimers and developing a robust backend for the service.
