- Overview: Manao.dev is a platform similar to AWS Lambda but designed to run
  Node.js code directly in the browser. It offers features like task scheduling
  (e.g., running code every 5 minutes), setting timeouts for code execution, and
  viewing detailed execution logs.
- Technologies Used: Built with Remix and Tailwind CSS for the front-end and UI
  components, deployed on my personal VPS. Continuous deployment is managed
  through GitHub Actions.
- Challenges and Solutions: One of the challenges was building a seamless code
  execution environment in the browser. To overcome this, I leveraged modern
  browser capabilities along with a robust backend infrastructure.
